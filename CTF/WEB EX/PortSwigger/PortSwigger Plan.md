- **Server-side vulnerabilities (Apprentice):** Start here. This is the introductory path designed by PortSwigger to give you a broad overview of essential concepts that all other vulnerabilities are built upon. You've already started it, so definitely finish this first.
    
- **SQL Injection:** This is arguably the most classic and common web vulnerability in CTFs. Nearly every web-focused CTF will have at least one SQLi challenge. Mastering the basics here is essential.
    
- **Path Traversal:** Also known as Directory Traversal, this is another very common and conceptually simple vulnerability in beginner CTFs. It's often the intended way to read flag files from the server (e.g., `/etc/passwd` or `C:\flag.txt`).
    
- **File upload vulnerabilities:** This is a frequent and fun CTF challenge category. You'll learn how to bypass filters to upload a web shell, giving you the ability to execute commands on the serverâ€”a common way to win a challenge.
    
- **Authentication vulnerabilities:** CTFs often require you to bypass a login page. This module covers the fundamental logic flaws, username enumeration, and password-based attacks needed to do that.
    
- **Server-side request forgery (SSRF):** SSRF has become extremely common in modern CTFs. Challenges often involve making the server fetch internal resources or scan the local network.
    
- **Cross-site request forgery (CSRF):** While slightly less common than the ones above in beginner "find-the-flag" scenarios, it's a core concept. CTF challenges involving CSRF often require you to craft a link to trick a simulated user or admin bot.
    
- **The Rest:** Topics like **CORS**, **NoSQL Injection**, **GraphQL**, **Race Conditions**, and **Prototype Pollution** are also valuable but tend to appear in more intermediate challenges or are variations of the core concepts listed above. Tackle them after you are comfortable with the top 7.
