# Proofs Regarding Prime Numbers
There are infinitely many prime numbers. This is proven by euclid.

Prime numbers of the form $2^n-1$ are called *Mersenne primes*. It is not currently known if there are infinitely many of them.
Mersenne primes are related to **perfect numbers**.

>[!important] Perfect Numbers
>A positive integer n is said to be a perfect number if it is equal to the sum of all positive integers smaller than n that divide n.

Euclid proved that if $2^n-1$ is prime, then $2^{n-1}(2^n-1)$ is a perfect number. Then Euler proved, that all even perfect numbers arises this way.

Twin primes, are primes that are close together, or have a distance of 2 (5 - 7, 29 - 31, 7949 - 7951).
