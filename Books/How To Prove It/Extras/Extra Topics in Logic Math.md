# Prenex Normal Form
A formula is in *prenex normal form* (PNF) if it is written as a string of quantifiers as the prefix, followed by quantifier-free part, called the **matrix**.
Example:
$$\forall x\exists y\exists z(P(x,y)\to P(x,z))\tag{PNF}$$
$$\forall x\exists y(P(x,y)\to \exists zP(x,z))\tag{NOT PNF}$$For more details and applications, read the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenex_normal_form)
