# Characteristics
The English language:
- Logically decentrlized (English spoken by groups of people can be very different)
- Politically decentralized (no one person/group controls the language)
- Architecturally decentralized (no single infrastructure is required for it to exists)

Meanwhile Blockchains are:
- Logically centralized (The mechanism of many different blockchains need to be compatible, there is a commonly agreed state)
- Politically decentralized (no one person/group controls it)
- Architecturally decentralized (no single point of failure)

>[!note]
>Blockchains have consensus protocols. Consensus means 'general agreement'

# Benefits
Since there is no single point of failure, it is difficult to attack it. 

# Solidity
view functions - read data without modifying
uses `cast call` or `cast send`
payable - bisa dibayar pake ether
