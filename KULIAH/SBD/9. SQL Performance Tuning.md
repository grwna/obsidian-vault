DBMS already performs optimization, however, there are still considerable room for improvement.

The majority of current database performance problems are poorly written SQL.

Recommendation:
- Index tuning
- Conditional expressions
- Query formulation

# Index Tuning
[[4. Indexing|Indexes]] are used when operations are related to an indexed column.

These are filters (WHERE, HAVING).
**Common Practices**:
