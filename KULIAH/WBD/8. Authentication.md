# Basic of Authentication
Three general ways:
- Something you **know** (i.e. Passwords)
- Something you **have** (i.e. Tokens)
- Something you **are** (i.e. Biometrics)

Can be stored in:
- Cookies
- Session attribute
- HTTP Header

How web apps do auth:
- Internal services (implement yourself)
- External services
	- OpenID+Connect (OpenID, OAuth2)
	- LDAP
	- SAML
	- CAS

# Common Protocols for Web
**LDAP** for authentication.

**OAuth**
Does authentication and authorization. Example when google asks for your consent of some website accessing certain data.

Website will redirect to google and asks for things instead of directly accessing data themselves.

Passwordless Token Exchange.

Drawbacks:
- Delegation granularity - some apps can ask for sensitive things, OAuth makes it so you can's use the service unless those sensitive data are given.
- Error Handling
- Token expiration vs revocation

# Remarks
- Make sure session lifetime is not too long
- Cookie can be accessible from JS. Be careful!
