Web Services supports interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network.
There is WSLD which is a standard for how to use web services (primarily SOAP, because REST usually differ services to services and thus require the developers to write teh documentations). WSDL is **machine procesable**.

**Characteristics of Web Service**
- Simple
- Web friendly: HTTP, XML based, JSON, TCP/IP
- Contract-oriented, with 2 approaches:
	- SOAP
	- REST (stateless, state transfer means state is transferred from server-client in each request)
- Technology/laguange agnostic
- Discoverable

Some important concepts:
- Web service has a requester-provider relationship.
- Loosely coupled: services provide independent functionalities
- Uses existing internet technology, so integrates seamlessly with older technologies.
- Is a service oriented **middleware**, it acts as a broker for communication.

HTTP is synchronous - Requests should have responses
SMPT is asynchronous - Emails can have no responses 
Both traffics are rarely blocked by firewall.

**WSDL specification has** 
- **abstract part**
	- messages
	- operation
	- port type
- **concrete part**
	- binding
	- port and service

**Communication Patterns in WSDL**
1. One way (client requests, server only responds with status codes)
2. Request-response (client requests)
3. Solicit-response (server initiates, client responds)
4. Notification (server initiates, client does not respond)

**SOA-system** requires you to follow standards, and are very strict which makes the learning curve steeper. 
WS can be: 
- **Orchestrated** - central entity arranged execution sequence (WS-BPEL)
- **Choreographed** - independent agents exchange messages (WS-CDL)

**Problems of Web Service and Distributed Objects**
- Latency
- Lack of shared memory between caller and object
- Partial failure scenarios (only some parts failed)
- Concurrent access to remote resources
- Fragile to incompatible updates 

**Web Services** are suitable for:
- platform neutrality is important, and overhead is tradeable
- Service needs to operate via internet
- Loosely coupled
