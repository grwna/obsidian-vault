# Database
When the locket is only 2, having 2 lanes of cars is faster than 5 lanes -> Contention (merging overhead).
**Putting Data**
**Retrieving Data**

Using fetch with loop -> slower because each fetch has overhead
Using fetchall -> faster but can be very high memory for big data

Be Careful for injection. **DO NOT EVER** concatenate query with user input.

**Remarks**
- Be careful with SQL wildcard (slow and unnecessarily big)
- Never trust other inputs (always sanitize)
- Open and Close connection wisely

# File
- Read
- Write
