An api for shared memory, designed for systems where each thread or process can access the same memory.

# Pragmas
it uses #pragma, also called a directive, which tells the compiler how to handle code.

`#pragma omp parallel` is the most basic OMP parallelization pragma.
It must be placed directly before a `for` loop.
# Trapezoidal Rule
An algorithm to calculate area under a curve, which can be threaded and is a good way to show parallelism
