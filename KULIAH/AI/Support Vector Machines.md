# What & Why
Objective of SVM is to find the optimal separating hyperplane which **maximizes the margin** of training data.
There won't be any data point inside the margin.

- Uses Quadratic Optimization to avoid **local minimum** that is present in NN (Greedy)
- Uses **kernel function** to separate non-liner region
