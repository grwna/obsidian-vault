# Definition
Agent acts according to the environment its in. For example, a coding agent in vscode will do things according to the code that you have, your OS, dependencies you use, etc.

Formally, an agent is anything that can be viewed as **perceiving** its environments through **sensors** and acting upon that environemnt through **actuators**

# Agent Model
- Percept Space
- Action Space
- Internal State
- Perception Function: $S\rightarrow P$
- World Dynamics: $S\times A\rightarrow S$

# Rational Agent
Strives to do the right thing:
- Based on what it can perceive
- Based on what it can perform
Has **Performance Measure** to measure its success.

# PEAS
- Performance Measure
- Environment
- Actuators
- Sensors

Example: Designing an automated taxi driver

| E         | Roads, other traffic, pedestrians, customers |
| A         | Steering wheel, accelerator, brake, horn     |

## Agent Structure
Architecture + Program (Percept* --> Actions)

The architecture includes hardware components, like sensors + actuators.
The program includes some types of agents:
- Simple Reflex Agent
- Model based Reflex Agent
- Goal based Agent
- Utility based Agent
- Learning Agent.

# Agent Level
- Level 1: Problem Solving Agent
- Level 2: Knowledge Based Agent
- Level 3: Learning Agent
