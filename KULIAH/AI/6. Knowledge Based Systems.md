Apply knowledge in solving problem with limited domains. The knowledge is fed from experts. 

# What & Why?
Logical Reasoning: Thinking Rationally
Pattern Recognition
- Template based
- Statisical based
- Structural/synactic based
- Deep learning based

Difference with conventional program

| KBS                                                                  | Conventional                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Ill-structured problem                                               | Well-structured problem                   |
| Expert determines actions,  but order of execution is by interpreter | Programmer determines acion and execution |
| Problem solving method + domain knowledge + daa                      | Algorithm + data                          |
Ill structured means uncerain solution, goal and unknown operator

KBS $\neq$ Expert System

# Knowledge-based Agent
Each step agen draws conclusion from available information. If the information is correct, solution is **guaranteed correct**.

**Knowldge based agen development**

**Knowledge Representation**
Syntax + Semantic, also a way to manipulate expression in a language.
Requirements for the representation are:
- No contradiction
- Each symbol is unique
- Explain objecs, relations, attributes
- Efficient manipulaion in systems

(i missed some slides here)
# KBS Examples
- Focused Crawler Domain X
- Vertical Search Engine

# Architecture
Problem-solving + knowledge + data

**Knowledge Acquisition**
- Direct (Expert directly gives to knowledge base)
- Indirect (Engineer gives to knowledge base by asking (elicitating) experts)

**General Architecture of KBS**
![[Pasted image 20250929101706.png]]
Ada konsep X-AI (Explanable AI)
The ones in the orange box is **optional**, the ones in grey has to exist

# Knowledge Representation
**Propositional and Predicate Logic**
**Semantic Networks (Ontology**
**Frames**
Represent knowledge in slot form

**Production Rule**
Knowldge in the form of actions and condition

**Case Based Reasoning**

**Bayes Network**
# Knowledge Engineering
**KBS Developer** -> a team of engineers/analyst creating a KBS

**Knowledge Acquisition**
- Knowledge elicitation
- Knowledge representation
