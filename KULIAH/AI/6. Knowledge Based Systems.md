Apply knowledge in solving problem with limited domains. The knowledge is fed from experts. 

# What & Why?
Logical Reasoning: Thinking Rationally
Pattern Recognition
- Template based
- Statisical based
- Structural/synactic based
- Deep learning based

| Ill-structured problem                                               | Well-structured problem                   |
| Expert determines actions,  but order of execution is by interpreter | Programmer determines acion and execution |
| Problem solving method + domain knowledge + daa                      | Algorithm + data                          |
| Undefined Goal                                                       | Explicit Goal                             |
Ill structured means uncerain solution, goal and unknown operator

KBS $\neq$ Expert System

# Knowledge-based Agent
In each step agent draws conclusion from available information. If the information is correct, solution is **guaranteed correct**.

Example: back again to wumpus world

**Knowldge Based Agent Development**
- Start with empty knowledge-base
	- The designer have no idea about the solution
- Designer can tell sentences one by one
	- Designers cannot anticipate all possible solution
- Agent knows how to operate in its environment
	- Designers cannot anticipate all changes over time

**Knowledge Representation**
Syntax + Semantic, also a way to manipulate expression in a language.
Requirements for the representation are:
- No contradiction
- Each symbol is unique
- Explain objecs, relations, attributes
- Efficient manipulaion in systems

Examples of Knowledge representations are Decision tree, Probability model, Semantic network. Divided into three categories
- Suitable for problem domain
- Suitable for the tasks (inference)
- Suitable for users (man or machine)
# KBS Examples
- Focused Crawler Domain X
- Vertical Search Engine
Many more examples

# Architecture
Problem-solving + knowledge + data

**Interactive** - inference engine uses the Knowledge-base to get solutions for problems the user has.
**Emdedded** - Doesn't interact with users, but with subsystems


**Knowledge Acquisition**
- Direct (Expert directly gives to knowledge base)
- Indirect (Engineer gives to knowledge base by asking (elicitating) experts)

# Knowledge Representation
**KR Techniques**
- Propositional and Predicate Logic
	- Knowledge-base that uses propositional logic or predicates to represent knowledge
- Semantic Networks (Ontology)
	- Represents knowledge in graph form, where concepts are nodes, and relationships are edges.
- Frames
	- Data structure that uses slots (storage) and filler (data to store in slot)
- Production Rule
	- If-then rules (kondisi-aksi)
- Case-based Reasoning
	- Uses solutions for previous or old problems (cases) to solve new similar problems
- Bayes Network
	- Reasoning under uncertainty
# Knowledge Engineering
Knowldge engineering is the acquisisition of knowledge in non-elekcronic forms/source and convert it to a form that **computers can use** to solve problems.

**Knowledge Acquisition**
- Knowledge elicitation - extracting knowledge from experts
- Knowledge representation - represent that knowledge

**Task in Elicitation**
In every iteration:
- **Collect** knowledge
- Determine **key concepts** in problem domain
- Establish **relationships** between concepts
- Decide how knowledge is **represented** in KBS
- Determine what knowledge needs collecting for next iteration

**Steps of Knowledge Acquisition**
- Identification
- Conceptualization - finds concepts to represent knowledge
- Formalization - design structure to organize knowledge
- Implementation
- Testing

**Techniques**

- Interview
- Observation
- Intuitive
