# Definition
A problem where you need to satisfy constraints. Ex: Graph Coloring Problem, where the constaint is that adjacent regions must have different colors.

## Concept
- Variables - ex. Nodes
- Domain - values that can be assigned to variables
- Constraints - ex. Link/Arc, Box

## Variations of CPS Formalism
Variables:
- Discrete - finite or infinite domain
- Continuous - Linear Programming, etc.

Constraints:
- Unary - contraints involving one node
- Binary - involving two nodes
- Higher-Order - ex. cryptarithmetic
- Preference - COP (C Optimization P)

# Inference
Constraint Propagation - using constraint to reduce legal values of a variable
Local Consistency:
- Node Consistency - consistency of one node (unary)
- Arc Consistency - two nodes
- Path Consistency - three nodes
- K Consistency - K nodes

Local Consistency is where a subset of variables is consistent to the constraints.
- A network is node-consistent if every variable in the networks is node-consistent
- A network is arc-consistent if every variable is arc-consistent with every other variable
 It basically means constraints aren't violated, and helps in pruning tree where constraints **are** violated (inconsistent).
