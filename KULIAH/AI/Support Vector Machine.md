# What & Why
Good performance in various applications like bioinformatics, text classification, etc.

**Binary Classification**
Given a training data ($x_{i},y_{i}$), with $x\in \mathbb{R}^d$ and $y\in{-1,1}$, learn a classifier function $f(x)$, such that if the value from $f(x) \geq{0}$, then $y=+1$, and other wise $y=-1$.

**Linear Separability**
A linearly separable data is a data in which when plotted, the values of two classes can be clearly and completely separated using a straigt line.

**Linear Classifier**
