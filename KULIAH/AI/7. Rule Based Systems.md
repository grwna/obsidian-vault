# What & Why?
RBS is KBS but uses **rules** as knowledge representation.
Rule = precondition - action

RBS is the simplest and most used solution in real world.

In Hybrid Approach, RBS is used very commonly

**RULE: Logical Implication**
Rules can be written in an IF-THEN format. The CLIPS language (C Language Integrated Production System) can be used for developing RBS.

**Architecture**
Uses the same model as [[6. Knowledge Based Systems#Architecture|KBS]].
- Production memory (long term) stores rules
- Working memory (short term) stores facts and inference results
- Inference/Pattern Matcher, checks facts with rules

**Rule Inference Methods**
- Forward Chaining
	- Data driven
	- Match LHS
- Backward Chaining
	- Goal driven
	- Match RHS
# Forward Chaining
Follows **Recognize-Act** Cycle

- Initialize data with facts
- Obtain conflict-set by pattern matching rules which are satisfied by data 
- Select a rule from conflict-set by conflict-resolving strategy
- Fire the selected rule (which will change the facts/data)
- Repeat iteration until termination condition

Conflict-resolution Strategy

| Global control                                         | Local control                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hardcoded into interpreter and thus domain independent | Must be added by developer because its domain dependent |

Global Control
- Seleciton by order
	- Rule Order - FIFO (First rules are selected first)
	- Fact Recency - LIFO (Last facts are selected first)
- Refactoriness - dont select a rule that has just been applied with the same values (prevent infinite loops)
- Selection by Syntactic Structure of Rule
	- Specificity - select most specific rule first
	
Local Control
Selection by Supplementary Knowledge
- Selection by priority
	- In CLIPS you can (declare salience {n}) which assigns priority to rules
- Selection by meta rules
