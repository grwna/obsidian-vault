Adversarial search is a search in which multiple [[2. Intelligent Agent|agents]] take turns to pick the most optimal values based on each's own goal.

Example: Minimax where one agent is trying to get the max value and another trying to get the min value.

# Definition
Formal definition:
- Initial State
- Player (s)
- Action (s)
- Result state based on action (s,a)
- Terminal test (s)
- Utility (s,p)
	- s - state
	- a - action
	- p - player

It uses a game tree, where the node: states, edge: moves
**NOTE:** when evaluating the tree, start from the bottom then work your way up. The 'root' node is the final result.

# Minimax
One turn is MAX, other turn is MIN. It has properties similar to DFS.

# Minimax With $\alpha\beta$ Pruning
My confusion stems from the fact that i thought the leaf nodes are the results, turns out it is very easy.
